Well, who am I? In a nutshell: a nerdy guy who's fascinated with tech and programming.

I like figuring out good UI's, building things and learning new tech.
My history of getting into programming can be summarized into this timeline:

- 2022 -- Moving from system and network administrator work in managed service provider company to working with homebrew CMS, learning SCSS and Figma, doing some basic things with Vue and JS
- 2023 -- Starting to learn React, starting pet project with my friends
- 2024 -- Making React webapps, learning telegram mini-app integration and its caveats
- 2025 -- Starting to move from React SPA's to SSG MPA, trying out Grafana
