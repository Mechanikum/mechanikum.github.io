Well, this one is my first website ever built. Whole thing was built in a few days with SCSS and ductaped to CMS in matter of hours, since its only just a bunch of galleries, the only tricky part was to adapt design from initial illustrator files to figma

The interesting thing about this one is only grid-like overlay over images, responding to scroll, shrinking away when user passes a point on the screen, bound to image container.
