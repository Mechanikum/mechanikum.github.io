Website for a company specializing in installing plastic windows, was built from the scratch based on desings in Figma. Frontend side of project was in my hands from the beginning

This one were made solely by me, from page HTML/CSS structure, to sliders, tabs and CMS configuration. Pretty simple tree-like structure of pages, where categories represent different services

Website went through few iterations, reassembling pages and its content, following edits from the customer side
